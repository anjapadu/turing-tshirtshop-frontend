## Turing T-SHIRTSHOP Backend

1. Done with my own custom boiler plate and custom cli to create reducers/selectors/constants/actions/routes/etc easily. It does not have a documentation yet but i will pimp it a little bit more :p (https://github.com/anjapadu/cligi)
2. Used bulma + sass customization. Generally i pass the styles like javascript objects. (React native habit). But because bulma is full css with no js i felt like trying to customize and override by component with sass/scss.
3. :'( I did not have time to finish my tests T_T to many work this last week and didn't want to lose the deadline. Gonna commit in a few days some main test just in case..
